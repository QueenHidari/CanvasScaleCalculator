# CanvasScaleCalculator
A calculator for determining canvas scale in Tower Unite based off of an image's resolution. The formula used in this calculator was developed by Jacob Swanson; link to his original forum post here:

The program takes an image's resolution, and outputs scale values to plug into Tower Unite, there is also an option to scale down, so you can achieve smaller sizes by scaling down the X and Y scales.
